Bug at the alignment of the hero section with the header section <-- seem like i haven't 
have enough knowledge to solve this problem. I will go back to the theory.

Trying to fix the bug at header section, but still can't figure out the problem. :(
Maybe I should add the community for this kind of dumb shit.
At least found a way --- try relative size
